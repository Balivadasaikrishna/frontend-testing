# Frontend Testing Demo - TASK 1

## Overview
This project demonstrates frontend testing using Playwright for end-to-end (E2E) tests and Jest with React Testing Library for unit tests, as required by TASK 1.

- **E2E Test Target:** [EspoCRM Demo](https://demo.us.espocrm.com/)
- **Unit Test Target:** Simple React Button component

## Framework Selection & Justification

### Playwright (E2E Testing)
- **Modern & Fast:** Built on modern web standards with excellent performance
- **Multi-browser Support:** Can test across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Reliable:** Better handling of modern web apps with built-in auto-waiting
- **CI/CD Ready:** Excellent integration with GitHub Actions and other CI platforms
- **TypeScript Native:** First-class TypeScript support

### Jest + React Testing Library (Unit Testing)
- **Industry Standard:** Most popular testing solution for React applications
- **User-Centric:** Tests focus on how users interact with components
- **Accessibility Focused:** Encourages testing from a user perspective
- **Comprehensive:** Built-in mocking, assertions, and test runner

## Test Implementation

### E2E Test Flow (Playwright)
1. **Login:** Navigate to EspoCRM demo, select admin user and language, authenticate
2. **View Leads List:** Navigate to Leads section and verify list is displayed
3. **Open Lead Details:** Click on first lead row and verify details page loads

### Unit Test (Jest + React Testing Library)
- **Button Component:** Tests rendering, click handling, and accessibility
- **App Component:** Tests component integration and state management

## ðŸš€ **Advanced CI/CD Pipeline**

### **Enterprise-Level Features:**
- **Multi-browser Testing:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari across different Node.js versions
- **Quality Gates:** Automated coverage thresholds (80% minimum) and test pass rates
- **Security Scanning:** Snyk vulnerability scanning with automated blocking
- **Performance Testing:** Lighthouse CI integration for performance benchmarks
- **Automated Deployment:** Staging deployment with smoke tests
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Slack notifications and comprehensive reporting

### **Pipeline Stages:**
```

## Naming Conventions
- **E2E tests:** `*.spec.ts` (Playwright standard)
- **Unit tests:** `*.test.tsx` (Jest standard)
- **Test folders:** `e2e/` for E2E, `unit/` for unit tests
- **Component files:** PascalCase (e.g., `Button.tsx`)

## How to Run Tests

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test:unit          # Basic unit tests
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
npm run test:ci            # CI-optimized tests
```

### 3. Run E2E Tests
```bash
npx playwright install     # (first time only, to install browsers)
npm run test:e2e           # All E2E tests
npm run test:smoke         # Smoke tests only
```

### 4. Run All Tests
```bash
npm test                   # All tests
npm run ci:full           # Full CI pipeline locally
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **CI/CD Integration**

### **GitHub Actions Pipeline**
The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that runs automatically:

```yaml
# Triggers: Push, Pull Request, Daily Schedule
# Jobs: Unit Tests, E2E Tests, Performance Tests, Security Scan, Quality Gates, Deployment
# Features: Multi-browser testing, Quality gates, Automated deployment
```

### **Key CI/CD Features**
- **Multi-Environment Testing:** Node.js 16, 18, 20 support
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- **Quality Gates:** 80% coverage threshold, 100% test pass rate
- **Security Scanning:** Automated vulnerability detection
- **Performance Testing:** Lighthouse CI integration
- **Automated Deployment:** Staging environment with smoke tests
- **Real-time Notifications:** Slack integration for team alerts

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, TypeScript compilation checks
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% coverage requirement
- **Performance:** Lighthouse score > 90 required
- **Security:** No high-severity vulnerabilities allowed

## Test Strategy

### E2E Testing Approach
- **Real User Simulation:** Tests mimic actual user workflows
- **Critical Path Coverage:** Focus on core business functionality (login â†’ leads â†’ details)
- **Reliable Selectors:** Use semantic selectors (roles, text content) over fragile CSS selectors
- **Proper Waiting:** Built-in auto-waiting for elements to be ready

### Unit Testing Approach
- **Component Isolation:** Test components in isolation
- **User Behavior Focus:** Test from user perspective, not implementation details
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure components are accessible
- **Event Handling:** Verify user interactions work correctly

## Browser Configuration
- **Default Browser:** Chrome (configured in `playwright.config.ts`)
- **Viewport:** 1280x720 for consistent testing
- **Headless Mode:** Configurable (currently set to `false` for development visibility)

## ðŸ“Š **Advanced Features**

### **Performance Testing**
- Lighthouse CI integration for performance benchmarks
- Automated performance regression detection
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

### **Security Testing**
- Snyk vulnerability scanning
- Dependency security analysis
- Automated security blocking
